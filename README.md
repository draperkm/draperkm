# Hi there üëã

**I'm training as Data Anlysts in the Insurance Services industry. I like solving puzzles and have a passion for machine learning**.

I focus on:

    - ETL data processing (SQL, R, SAS, Databricks, Spark)
    - Machine learning models software engineering best practices (Git, Linux)
    - Deployment of ML models and front-end/back-end integration (Flask/FastAPI)
