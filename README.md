# Hi there üëã

**I'm training as Data Anlysts in the field of insurances. I like solving puzzles and have a passion for machine learning**.

I focus on:
 
    - Machine learning models
    - Software engineering best practices 
    - Integrating models in back-end and front-end applications (Flask/FastAPI)
    - Using data storage and data processing technologies (SAS, PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB, Spark)
